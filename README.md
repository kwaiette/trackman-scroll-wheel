# trackman-scroll-wheel
Adds scroll wheel functionality to the Logitech Trackman trackball using AutoHotKey.

This AHK script uses XButton1 (mouse button 4, the secondary button next to the left click) as a modifier. When this button is down, movement of the trackball is translated to vertical and horizontal scroll events and passed to the active component.

This script was mostly written by Erik Elmore, I've just added horizontal scrolling to his work. I have also reversed the scroll direction so that it behaves more like swiping to scroll on a touchscreen. I've used and loved my Logitech Trackman for 15+ years, but as more and more UIs are being designed to rely on a scroll wheel or a touchscreen, using this pointing device was getting frustrating. The scrolling options in Logitech's SetPoint software left much to be desired, so I was contemplating buying a more expensive trackball that I probably wouldn't like as well. I found this AHK script which was almost exactly what I wanted, and I added to it.
